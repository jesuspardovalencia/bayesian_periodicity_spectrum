# Bayesian periodicity spectrum
Toolbox (MATLAB, Python) for the Bayesian periodicity spectrum.

This code was developed for the computation of the Bayesian periodicity spectrum, which is based on the variability of the instantaneous frequency. The Bayesian periodicity spectrum quantifies oscillatory activity at each frequency component without confounds from underlying non-oscillatory components, and is extended with a Bayesian framework to formally assess the presence or the absence of oscillations. With this novel approach, we aim to resolve the ambiguity of algorithms that rely solely on the power spectrum for the separation of oscillatory and non-oscillatory components in signals.
